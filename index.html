        <strong><em>A Croissant Made Of?</strong></em><br />
A croissant is typically made of yeast-risen dough. The dough is first layered with butter and then rolled. It is folded many times in a process called lamination. Then the dough is cut into triangles, rolled to form a crescent shape and baked. The lamination process gives croissants its flaky texture and fluffy shape.
We all love options, and when it comes to croissants, there are many types to choose from. Let’s take a look at the various types of croissants available.

<br /><strong><em> Croissant Au Beurre </strong></em> <br />
This variant of the flaky pastry is delicious, as it is made with lots of butter. With every bite, your taste buds are treated to the salty, flavoursome taste of butter. Theobroma’s butter croissant is crescent shaped and made up of over 70 layers of flaky pastry. It pairs well with tea and coffee so add this to your breakfast menu or enjoy it as a teatime snack.

<br /><strong><em> Pain Au Chocolat </strong></em> <br />
This type of croissant has the goodness of two tasty ingredients - butter and chocolate. The croissant is made by folding bars of chocolate into the buttery dough and then baking it. Theobroma’s pain au chocolat is made by folding pure couverture chocolate between Danish pastry dough.
